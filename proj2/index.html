          <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
          <p>
              In this project, we built Bezier Curves for both 2D and 3D surfaces, and we also implemented edit properties on 3D meshes,
              such as flipping surfaces, splitting surfaces, and sub dividing surfaces to make a smoother, more realistic overall mesh.
              What stood out to us the most in this project was the overall sub division. Specifically how simple operations such as flipping
              edges and splitting triangles can produce such a smooth and beautiful sub division algorithm that can polish any mesh.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

          <p>
              de Casteljau's algorithm is used to generate Bezier Curves from any array of points. The algorithm first finds points along
              each line segment between our data points, and it then connects each of those points to each other by creating
              line segments between them. The algorithm continues this process until we only have one line segment left, and one
              midpoint between them. That midpoint must lie on our Bezier Curve. We repeat for every point along the line segments of
              our original data points, and each of the final midpoints generated from those generates our whole Bezier Curve for the data.

              For this part of the question, we only implemented the first step of de Casteljau's algorithm: we found the intermediate points
              of our data points, so if we have n points, we return n - 1 intermediate points. We are able to repeat this on each sub step to get the
              final Bezier points that lay on the cure.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

          <p>
              Given any 3D surface, we can take many 2D de Casteljau Bezier Curves along the plane of the surface. For each of the
              Bezier Curves, form a new Bezier curve for each point that lies along the 2D Bezier curves. Thus we'd have a Bezier surface, which is
              generated from calling de Casteljau on the points in the planes and then calling de Casteljau on each of the points of the Bezier Curves generated from
              the previous de Casteljau callings.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

          <p>
              We take a weighted average of each vector by all the vectors neighboring it, where each weight is made from taking the cross product of the vectors.
              Thus each vector is adjusted by how fast its angle and magnitude transitions to the vectors neighboring it, so this weighted process creates a shading effect
              on the mesh.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

          <p>
              Here we flip an edge between two triangles. We don't create any new vertices nor edges, but merely reassign their locations and what each edge/vertex/face/halfedge
              points to. Thus we modify the data such that each already existing element changes the structure of the mesh.
              On our debugging journey, we first implemented edge flips, but when we completed the next part, edge-splits, we realized that flipping a split edge didn't work.
              So we copied our code for edge splits, pasted it into edge flips, and downscaled our work to handle just the flip case without creating any new variables.
              Since edge flip was a downscaled version of our implementation of edge split, every pointer reassignment process matched between our two versions, so that
              no inconsistencies would arise when performing them together.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

          <p>
              Here we split two connected triangles into 4 sub triangles. Unlike edge flips, since we created more triangles, we had to
              make new variables for edges, faces, points, and half edges. We drew our diagram rigorously of the triangles before and
              after splitting on pen and paper beforehand, then we coded our pointer assignments to follow the convention we drew out. We
              arrived at a few bugs when splitting, but nothing that re-examining our code and noticing an assignment typo couldn't fix.
              After finishing, we realized that we could split flipped edges, but we couldn't flip split edges, so we copied our code for split
              into flip and downscaled the code to handle the flip case.

          <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
          <p>
              We split each triangle into four triangles by first splitting every edge, then flipping only the edges that connected a
              new point to an old point. Thus the splitting created the extra variables we needed, and the flipping reassigned them so that
              the new triangles would subdivide the larger triangle. For finding the midpoint, we modified our split function, where we
              used the edge position as our midpoint, where the edge position was found by the 3/8, 1/8, 3/16, 3 / (8n) weighting as described
              in the project specs. After we finished our implementation, we noticed that our sub division algorithm made each point's
              new position start at 0, thus creating a springy array of lines rather than a mesh. After debugging, we realized that our
              weighting equation scaled down to integers, so each weight had a weight of 0. After converting our weights to floats, the
              algorithm worked as expected and each sub division made the mesh smoother.

              The two images below compares and contrasts how sub division may affect sharp corners of
              a mesh. The first image shows how the tea pot hole blends as it goes down, with no sub divisions. As we can see however, the last image has 3 sub divisions,
              and now the tea pot hole is jagged with a clear and unnatural ring in the faucet. If we were to pre-sample this mesh first by splitting, we could reduce this
              unnatural effect, as we will see in the cube example below.

          <p>
              In the cube example, we first see our cube before sub dividing. We hope to form a sphere with infinite sub divisions,
              but with just a few sub divisions we see a shape asymmetric and distorted, which isn't the approximation of a sphere as we
              hoped for. The issue is that our edges in the cube were already asymmetric, so sub dividing them only exacerbate that asymmetry.
              To solve this, the third picture below demonstrates our pre-sampling technique. We split each face of our cube, so that
              each face is now symmetric to each other, and then we sub divided our cube. Since our lines were symmetric, each sub division
              kept that symmetry, so our cube better approximates a sphere, with no asymmetric distortions. as shown in the last image after a
              few sub divisions.
